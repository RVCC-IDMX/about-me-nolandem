                    <h2>Frankenstein - Mary Shelley</h2>

                    <div>   

                        <p>I passed the summer thus engaged in my laboratory. The leaves of that year had withered
                             before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly 
                             how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was 
                            checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil
                             in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.</p>

                        <p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul,
                             in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the
                              fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a 
                              more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the
                               charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect
                                the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends 
                                who were so many miles absent.</p>

                        <p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the 
                            accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost 
                            amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around 
                            me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless 
                            thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; 
                            the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was 
                            nearly burnt out.</p>
