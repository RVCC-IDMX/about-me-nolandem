            <p>I enjoy walking and bike riding. These two activities help me get fit and are nice calming things to do after a long day.</p>
            <p>Videogames are my favorite pass time. They are fun to play with friends and are super relaxing
            and give me something to improve at other than school.</p>
            <p>My favorite food is pasta but I like alot of other foods as well. Some include pizza, mac and cheese, burgers, and chicken. </p>
            <p> I dream to be great. One day I wish to have a Job that I love and believe to be satisfied with beyond just making money. 
            I want to be able to look back on my life when I am older and be proud of what I accomplished as a human. Im excited for what life
            will throw at me and I will adapt and change to be the best version of myself I can be.

                <li>Videogames</li>
                <p> I enjoy video games as they provide a nice pass time to make friends and socialize after a long day of school,

                <li>Building Keyboards</li>
                <p> I love building custom mechanical keyboards its been a hobby of mine for a long time, although at times its hard to keep up
                    as the parts are very expensive.
                </p>
                <li>Tabletop Games</li>
                 <p>This is something that I recently picked up. Ive started to play games like warhammer 40k with my friends at a local game store.
                    Its been a super fun way to hang out with my friends as well as meeting new people. I also enjoy the painting and building the models
                    that I play with, its been a great way to help me stay creative even when I feel down.
                 </p>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <p>I love to cook, its always been a passion of mine. My favorite thing to make is my famous gnocci which is like a potato pasta.
                    The first time ive made it was with my grandfather who also loved to cook and its been something ive enjoyed ever since.

                <h2>Frankenstein - Mary Shelley</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>I passed the summer thus engaged in my laboratory. The leaves of that year had withered
                        before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly
                        how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was
                        checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil
                        in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite
                        employment.</p>

                    <p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul,
                        in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the
                        fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a
                        more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the
                        charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect
                        the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends
                        who were so many miles absent.</p>

                    <p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the
                        accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost
                        amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around
                        me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless
                        thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning;
                        the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was
                        nearly burnt out.</p>
