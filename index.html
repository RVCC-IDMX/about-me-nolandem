                <h2>Frankenstein - Mary Shelley</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>I passed the summer thus engaged in my laboratory. The leaves of that year had withered
                        before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly
                        how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was
                        checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil
                        in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite
                        employment.</p>

                    <p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul,
                        in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the
                        fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a
                        more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the
                        charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect
                        the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends
                        who were so many miles absent.</p>

                    <p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the
                        accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost
                        amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around
                        me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless
                        thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning;
                        the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was
                        nearly burnt out.</p>
