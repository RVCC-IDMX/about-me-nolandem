## Project Description 
This website is an about me page that was made as a project for my web page development course at raritan valley community college.
Throughout this class I learned many ways to develope a website and make a coherent website that includes many features like a nav bar,
styling in css, how to format images and text in the webpage, how to make my website accessable through different systems like an I pad or phone or computer, and much more. I learned how to use git hub and use my git repository to edit my code and publish it to git hub. I also learned to use my repository to set up a netlify website link to share my project with the world. Most of this project was done in html and getting all the information down in paragraphs and header but the styling was done in css to make it look better. Some of the things in this project were made up like my buisness unfortunately does not exist but is used as an example to represent my new found skill in creating website.
